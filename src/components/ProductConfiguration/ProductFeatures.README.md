# ProductFeatures Component Refactoring

## Overview
The ProductFeatures component has been refactored to reduce complexity from 18 to under 10 and improve maintainability by breaking it down into smaller, focused components.

## Refactoring Changes

### Before
- **Single file**: 67 lines with complexity 18
- **Mixed responsibilities**: Feature display, specifications, animation logic all in one component
- **Repetitive code**: Similar animation classes and styles repeated throughout
- **Complex conditional rendering**: Multiple nested conditions for animations and styling

### After
- **Main component**: 35 lines with complexity reduced to under 10
- **Modular architecture**: Separated into focused components and utilities
- **Reusable components**: Each component has a single responsibility
- **Clean animation handling**: Centralized animation utilities

## New Structure

### Components
- **`FeaturesList.tsx`** (35 lines): Handles product features display with animations
- **`SpecificationItem.tsx`** (32 lines): Individual specification item component
- **`SpecificationsSection.tsx`** (35 lines): Manages specifications display

### Hooks
- **`useProductFeatures.ts`** (25 lines): Custom hook for product features logic

### Utils
- **`animationUtils.ts`** (14 lines): Centralized animation class and style utilities

### Index Files
- **`components/index.ts`**: Exports all components
- **`hooks/index.ts`**: Exports all hooks

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Main component complexity reduced from 18 to under 10
2. **Better Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
3. **Improved Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
4. **Cleaner Code**: Eliminated repetitive animation code
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all components
6. **Better Testing**: Smaller components are easier to test individually

## Usage

```tsx
import ProductFeatures from './ProductFeatures';

// Basic usage
<ProductFeatures product={product} />

// With animation controls
<ProductFeatures 
  product={product}
  isVisible={true}
  animationFinished={true}
/>
```

## Component Props

### ProductFeatures
- `product?: Product` - Product data (optional)
- `isVisible?: boolean` - Controls visibility animations (default: true)
- `animationFinished?: boolean` - Controls animation completion state (default: true)

All components maintain backward compatibility with the original API.
